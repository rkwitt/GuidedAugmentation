# Attribute-Guided Augmentation (AGA)

Created by Mandar Dixit (UCSD) and Roland Kwitt (Univ. of Salzburg)

## Introduction

AGA is an augmentation technique in feature space that *learns how
features change as a function of some auxiliary attribute*. 

As an example, we show how to use AGA to augment CNN features 
obtained from a RCNN detector for one-shot object recognition
in a transfer-learning setting. We use the SUN RGB-D database
for this purpose, where the auxiliary attributes are *depth* and
*pose* (rotation around the z-axis).

## Requirements

At the core, AGA is implemented in Torch and Python.
