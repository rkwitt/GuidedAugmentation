# Attribute-Guided Augmentation (AGA)

Created by Mandar Dixit (UCSD) and Roland Kwitt (Univ. of Salzburg)

## Introduction

AGA is an augmentation technique in feature space that learns how
features change as a function of some auxiliary attribute. 

As an example, we show how to use AGA to augment CNN features 
obtained from a RCNN detector for one-shot object recognition
in a transfer-learning setting.
