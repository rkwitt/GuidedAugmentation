HOWTO
-----

0. Copy models folder to some location on harddisk

1. Edit config.yaml and ajust settings to reflect system configuration

2. Run augment.py as

python augment.py \
	-c config.yaml \
	-i /scratch2/rkwitt/Mount/images/image_05335_bbox_features.mat \
	-s object_classes.txt \
	-t object_classes.txt  \
	-v \
	-g 0.8 \
	-y info_full.yaml \
	-o image_05335_bbox_features_EDN.mat

Here, 0.8 is the detection threshold to prune detections. I would use
at least 0.7 not to get too many.

-s object_classes.txt
-t object_classes.txt

is currently the same. For object-agnostic stuff we will need this,
but it's not done yet.

3. Load image_05335_bbox_features_EDN.mat in MATLAB, you get two variables

	1. CNN_features
	2. CNN_metadata
